If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these Terms or our products and services, please contact us at <a href="mailto:brytebookhq@gmail.com">brytebookhq@gmail.com.</a></p>
    <p>Using Brytebook in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use Brytebook. These Terms include everything in this document, as well as those in the Privacy Policy, Publisher Agreement, Content Guidelines, and Copyright Dispute Policy. If you don't agree to all of the following, you may not use or access Brytebook in any manner.</p>
    <p>You represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, that you've received your parent's or guardian's permission to use Brytebook and that your parent or guardian agrees to these Terms on your behalf). If you're agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization or entity's behalf and bind them to these Terms (in which case, the references to “you” and “your” throughout this document refer to that organization or entity).</p>

    <p><strong>Posting Content on Brytebook</strong></p>
    <p>First and foremost, you own what you create. Any original content you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide to Brytebook remains yours and is protected by copyright and any other applicable intellectual property laws.</p>

    <p>Anything posted, uploaded, shared, stored, or otherwise provided through Brytebook is referred to as a “Post” in these Terms. There are a few rules that apply to all Posts:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Don't Infringe: Your Posts should not violate someone else's (including Brytebook's) rights. Don't copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell, commercialize or otherwise exploit for any purpose any content not owned by you unless you have prior consent from the owner of that content.</li>

We will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account so that you are able to retrieve any important Posts you may have uploaded to your account, but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone's safety or security, or otherwise harmful to the rights or property of Brytebook.</p>
    <p>Brytebook also allows you to delete your account at any time. When you delete your account, any Posts associated with that account will also be deleted. However, any Post that you have made public may remain available.</p>

    <p><strong>Changes to Brytebook</strong></p>
    <p>We're always trying to improve Brytebook, so our products and services may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of Brytebook, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of Brytebook. We'll try to give you notice when we make a material change to Brytebook that would adversely affect you, but this isn't always possible or practical.</p>
    <p><strong>Changes to the Terms</strong></p>
    <p>We are constantly trying to improve our products and services, so these Terms may need to change along with Brytebook.  We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.</p>
    <p>If you don't agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use Brytebook.  If you use Brytebook in any way after a change to the Terms is effective and notice has been provided, that means you agree to all of the changes.</p>
    <p>Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.</p>
    <p><strong>Violations of the Terms</strong></p>
    <p>Failure to follow any of these Terms shall constitute a breach of these Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account. Brytebook has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.</p>
    <p><strong>Miscellaneous Terms</strong></p>
    <p>The above covers most of the questions that we typically receive about Brytebook. We have grouped provisions that come up less frequently below:</p>
    <ul>

In the event of such a claim, suit, or action, we will attempt to provide notice to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder).</li>
    <li>Assignment: You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Brytebook account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without our prior written consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.</li>
    <li>Choice of Law: These Terms are governed by and will be construed under applicable federal law and the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.</li>

Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.

For all purposes of these Terms, you consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, San Francisco County, California, or the Northern District of California. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding arising out of these Terms will be entitled to an award of costs and attorneys' fees. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and Brytebook Inc agree that all claims against the other can only be brought in an individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, consolidated, or other representative proceeding. We agree that arbitrators may not conduct any class, consolidated, or representative proceeding, and are limited to providing relief warranted by an individual party&#39;s claim.</li>
    <li>No Third-Party Beneficiaries: We agree there are no third-party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.</li>

    <li>Severability: If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.</li>
    <li>Entire Agreement: You agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and us, and that it supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms.</li>
    </ul>
